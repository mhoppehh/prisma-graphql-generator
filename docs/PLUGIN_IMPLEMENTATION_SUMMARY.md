# Plugin and Hook System Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive plugin and hook system for the Prisma GraphQL Generator that allows functions to be executed at every stage of the generation process to modify or read values before they're used by the next stage.

## Core Components

### 1. Plugin System Types (`src/plugins/types.ts`)
- `HookName` - Enum of all available hooks in the generation lifecycle
- `HookContext` - Context object passed to hooks containing all relevant data
- `HookResult` - Return type for hooks to modify the generation process
- `Plugin` - Interface defining a plugin structure
- `PluginManager` - Interface for managing plugins

### 2. Plugin Manager (`src/plugins/manager.ts`)
- `DefaultPluginManager` - Core implementation for plugin registration and execution
- Global `pluginManager` instance
- Hook execution with error handling and context merging
- Plugin lifecycle management (initialize/cleanup)

### 3. Built-in Plugins (`src/plugins/builtin/`)
- **Logging Plugin** - Logs all generation stages for debugging
- **Validation Plugin** - Validates config, models, and generated content
- **Field Transform Plugin** - Transforms fields with custom naming, types, and directives

### 4. Plugin Loader (`src/plugins/loader.ts`)
- Auto-loads built-in plugins
- Supports custom plugin registration
- Plugin discovery framework (placeholder for future expansion)

## Hook Points Implemented

The system provides hooks at **11 key stages** of the generation process:

1. **`onGenerateStart`** - Called when generation begins
2. **`onConfigParsed`** - Called after environment variables are parsed
3. **`onModelFound`** - Called after the Prisma model is found in DMMF
4. **`onOptionsCreated`** - Called after GenerateModuleOptions is created
5. **`onTemplateDataPrepared`** - Called after Handlebars template data is prepared
6. **`onTypesGenerated`** - Called after GraphQL input/output types are generated
7. **`onSDLGenerated`** - Called after SDL (GraphQL schema) content is generated
8. **`onResolverGenerated`** - Called after resolver TypeScript content is generated
9. **`onFileWritten`** - Called after each file is written to disk
10. **`onGenerateComplete`** - Called when generation is complete
11. **`onError`** - Called when any error occurs during generation

## Generator Integration

### Modified Files:
- **`src/generator.ts`** - Added plugin loading and hook execution at entry point
- **`src/helpers.ts`** - Integrated hooks throughout the generation pipeline

### Hook Integration Points:
- Config parsing and validation
- Model discovery and modification
- Template data preparation
- Type generation
- Content generation (SDL and resolvers)
- File writing operations

## Key Features

### ✅ **Complete Lifecycle Coverage**
Every stage of the generation process has hook points

### ✅ **Data Modification**
Plugins can modify any data at any stage (config, models, templates, content)

### ✅ **Error Handling**
Comprehensive error handling with dedicated error hooks

### ✅ **Metadata Sharing**
Plugins can share data through the metadata system

### ✅ **Process Control**
Plugins can skip operations or stop the generation process

### ✅ **Built-in Plugins**
Ready-to-use plugins for common needs (logging, validation, field transforms)

### ✅ **Plugin Lifecycle**
Initialize and cleanup hooks for resource management

### ✅ **Type Safety**
Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Plugin Registration
```typescript
import { pluginManager } from './src/plugins'

pluginManager.register(myPlugin, { enabled: true })
```

### Using Default Plugins
```typescript
import { loadDefaultPlugins } from './src/plugins'

// Automatically loads logging and validation plugins
await loadDefaultPlugins()
```

### Custom Plugin Creation
```typescript
const myPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'my-plugin',
  hooks: {
    onModelFound: (context) => {
      // Modify the model
      return { model: modifiedModel }
    },
    onSDLGenerated: (context) => {
      // Modify generated SDL
      return { generatedContent: modifiedSDL }
    }
  }
}
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/plugins/types.ts` - Core type definitions
- `src/plugins/manager.ts` - Plugin manager implementation
- `src/plugins/index.ts` - Main exports
- `src/plugins/loader.ts` - Plugin loading utilities
- `src/plugins/builtin/logging.ts` - Logging plugin
- `src/plugins/builtin/validation.ts` - Validation plugin
- `src/plugins/builtin/fieldTransform.ts` - Field transformation plugin
- `src/plugins/builtin/index.ts` - Built-in plugin exports
- `docs/PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `examples/example-plugin.ts` - Example plugin implementations

### Modified Files:
- `src/generator.ts` - Added plugin system integration
- `src/helpers.ts` - Added hooks throughout generation pipeline

## What This Enables

### For Plugin Developers:
- **Field Transformation** - Rename fields, change types, add directives
- **Content Modification** - Modify generated SDL and resolver code
- **Validation** - Add custom validation rules for models and config
- **Logging & Debugging** - Monitor and debug the generation process
- **Business Rules** - Enforce organizational standards and conventions
- **Integration** - Connect with external systems and tools

### For Generator Users:
- **Customization** - Tailor the generator to specific needs without modifying core code
- **Extensibility** - Add new functionality through plugins
- **Debugging** - Better visibility into the generation process
- **Validation** - Catch errors and enforce standards early
- **Flexibility** - Adapt the generator to different project requirements

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

While the core system is complete and functional, future enhancements could include:

1. **Plugin Discovery** - Automatic loading of plugins from directories
2. **Configuration File Support** - JSON/YAML plugin configuration files
3. **Plugin Marketplace** - Registry of community plugins
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Plugin execution timing and optimization
5. **Hot Reloading** - Dynamic plugin loading during development
6. **Plugin Dependencies** - Plugin dependency management and ordering

The system is now ready for use and provides a solid foundation for extending the generator's capabilities through plugins!
